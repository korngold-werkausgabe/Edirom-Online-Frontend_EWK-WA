## Get started

Edirom-Online Frontend is the frontend for the [Edirom-Online](https://github.com/Edirom/Edirom-Online) software. It is a web application written in JavaScript, and is designed for deployment in [eXist-db]. Its development is closely connected to the [Edirom-Online Frontend](https://github.com/Edirom/Edirom-Online-Frontend) and the Edirom-Online as a whole. Please see the GitHub repository for [Edirom-Online](https://github.com/Edirom/Edirom-Online) for planning information, issue listings, and further documentation. 

### Cloning this repository

```bash
git clone <project url>
```

### Building locally

For building Edirom Online you need *ant* installed on your system. 
Alternatively, you can use a Docker container image for building, e.g. [bwbohl/sencha-cmd]

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/YOUR/LOCAL/EDIROM-ONLINE-FRONTEND/CLONE:/app --name ediBuild ghcr.io/bwbohl/sencha-cmd:latest
```

When you have your system prepared with all prerequisites or you have your docker container running you are now set up to execute the build command. Do this by calling the build script included in this repository, either in your native shell or in the container shell, e.g.:

```bash
./build.sh
```

#### Overriding build properties locally

Build properties can be overridden by creating a `local.properties` file in the root directory. This file allows you to customize any Ant properties without modifying the build script.

Available properties for override:
- `backend.protocol` (default: `http`)
- `backend.host` (default: `localhost`)
- `backend.port` (default: `8080`)
- `backend.path` (default: `/exist/apps/Edirom-Online-Backend/`)
- `project.version` (default: `1.0.1`)
- `project.app` (default: `Edirom-Online-Frontend`)
- `project.title` (default: `Edirom-Online Frontend`)
- `repo.target` (default: `Edirom-Online-Frontend`)
- `build.dir` (default: `build`)
- `dist.dir` (default: `build-xar`)
- `temp.dir.name` (default: `temp`)
- `euryanthe.dir` (default: `build-euryanthe`)
- `exist.dir` (default: `exist-packaging`)

Example `local.properties`:
```properties
backend.protocol=https
backend.host=my-custom-host
backend.port=9090
project.version=2.0.0
```


### Starting an Edirom instance locally

* prepare **exist-db**
  * also see [exist-db via Docker]
  * `docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 --name exist stadlerpeter/existdb:6` (see stadlerpeter/existdb)
  * open in browser: `http://localhost:8080` (Note: there were problems opening this in Safari)
  * Login with "admin:[empty]"
* build and deploy **xar of Edirom-Online Backend**
  * also see [building locally] above
  * at `http://localhost:8080/exist/apps/dashboard/admin#` (signed-in) go to "Package Manager" then "Upload" and select the xar file which (supposed above build-method was used) was built at `/PATH_TO_LOCAL_EDIROM_REPO/build-xar/Edirom-Online-Backend-1.0.1-[TIMESTAMP].xar`
* build and deploy **xar of Edirom-Online Frontend**
  * for building the frontend module please see https://github.com/Edirom/Edirom-Online-Frontend
  * at `http://localhost:8080/exist/apps/dashboard/admin#` (signed-in) go to "Package Manager" then "Upload" and select the xar file which (supposed above build-method was used) was built at `/PATH_TO_LOCAL_EDIROM_REPO/build-xar/Edirom-Online-Frontend-1.0.1-[TIMESTAMP].xar`
* build **xar of sample data** for deploying at exist-db
  * also see [building sample data]
  * at `http://localhost:8080/exist/apps/dashboard/admin#` (signed-in) go to "Package Manager" then "Upload" and select the xar file which (supposed above build-method was used) was built at `/PATH_TO_LOCAL_EDIROM_EDITION_EXAMPLE_REPO/build/EditionExample-0.1.xar`
* in **eXist-db Package Manager** click on the "Edirom Online Frontend" entry - you will be directed to the running Edirom at `http://localhost:8080/exist/apps/Edirom-Online-Frontend/index.html`
